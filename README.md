You need this repository cloned to your PC: https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile 

Follow its installation instructions and then edit this project's Makefile so that path to Arduino.mk is correct.

Then clone this: https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/FreqCount and move it to your Arduino IDE /libraries folder.

Connect the buzzer output to pin 5, speaker amplifier input to pin 11 and enjoy your sound, whichever one you upload!
